# URL MINIMIZER

## OVERVIEW

`URL Minimizer` is a user-friendly Python application designed to shorten long URLs using the `TinyURL service`. The graphical user interface (GUI) is built using tkinter, providing a seamless experience for users to input any URL they want to shorten. Once the user enters the URL and presses the enter key, the application utilizes the `pyshorteners` library to interact with the `TinyURL API` and fetch the shortened URL. The result is then displayed below, allowing users to easily copy and share the shortened URL.

## Features:

- Shorten long URLs with a single click.
- Provides `error handling` for invalid URLs or other issues.
- Displays the shortened URL for easy copying and sharing.

## Usage:

1. Enter the URL you want to shorten in the input box.
2. Press the ENTER button or hit the Enter key.
3. The shortened URL will be provided below for easy access and sharing.

## Note:

- Ensure you have an active internet connection to access the TinyURL API.
- The application uses the TinyURL service to generate the shortened URL.
- Please make sure to enter a valid URL to get the correct shortened link.
- The application's code is written in Python, utilizing libraries like tkinter and pyshorteners.
